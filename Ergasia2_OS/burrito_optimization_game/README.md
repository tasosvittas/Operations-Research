The Burrito Optimization Game is an educational game designed to introduce students to the power of optimization. In the game, the player places burrito trucks on a city map to earn as much profit as possible. In playing the game, the player is essentially solving an optimization problem “by hand”. The game is designed to introduce players to optimization—what it is, what it’s useful for, and why it’s hard to do by hand. To play the game, you must be logged in to your Gurobi account on a desktop.
